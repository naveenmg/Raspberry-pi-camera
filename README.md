# Raspberry-pi-camera

The goal of the project is to construct and programme a camera unit for the use on an agricultural robot. 
The camera should be built around a chassis that is apt for the agricultural robot and the camera should be able to capture images on command. 
The use of Raspberry pi for the completion of the task makes wireless communication possible along with the possibility of future enhancements.

### The entire project was completed wirelessly with the help of the VNC Viewer application, which allowed the creation, completion and further editing of the work over a mobile phone.

Instead of running the code of the Pi camera on the terminal, the code can be written in Python and run.
The images that are captured are saved in the specified folder and send as attachments via email simultaneously. 
Python provides smtplib module, which defines an SMTP client session object, which is used to send mail to any Internet machine.
